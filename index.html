    <h2 class="stone_names">The 2017 Stone</h2>
<p>I've had kidney stones before (apparently, I am a "stone maker") but never like this. On the morning of September 28, 2017, I woke up in <em>severe</em> pain. After doing everything I could to try to relieve the pain, I went to the ER. I was taken in for tests, diagnosed with a 4 mm kidney stone in my left kidney, and sent home with pain meds. Two days later, still in a ton of pain but also with a high fever, I was urged to go back to the ER. Upon arrival, I found out I was going septic because the stone had gotten stuck and the previous ER doctor had not put me on antibiotics. I was rushed into emergency surgery to place a stent, ended up coding that night, and landed myself in the ICU for three weeks, in kidney failure, with pneumonia and other organs attempting to shut down. I ended up needing a nephrostomy tube, which is a tube that goes into your kidney and out your back to lighten the kidney's workload. After not being able to pass this stone, it was finally surgically removed along with the stent. FYI, stents are horrible and painful.
I named this stone Donald Trump, because it tried to ruin everything.</p>

<h2 class="stone_names">The 2018 Stone</h2>
<p>On September 28 of 2018, I noticed an all too familiar feeling in my lower back, but thought that my head was just playing tricks on me because it was the one year anniversary of my dramatic stone. By September 30, I decided I probably needed to go to the hospital. After some tests, it was determined that I had a 4mm stone, again in my left kidney. This hospital stay was only one week this time, but I had to get the nephrostomy tube again. After a week of trying to pass the stone at home, I went in for surgery to get it removed. This stone was named Mitch McConnell and we were all relieved to see it gone.

<h2>The 2019 StoneS!</h2>
<p>On the morning of November 12, I woke up again with a familiar pain and promptly went to the ER. After tests, it was determined that I indeed had a stone, but this time in my right kidney. Because it was only 2mm in size, the doctor determined I could pass it myself at home with medication and sent me on my way. 24 hours later, I passed my first kidney stone without needing surgery, stents, or tubes. This one was named Mike Parsons, after Missouri's governor. Shortly after passing Parsons, I got a notification that my CT results were back and on the app. I immediately went to check and read the report that said I had a stone in both kidneys! After a discussion with the far <em>too</em> happy nurse at my doctor's office, I was told I also had a 4mm stone, again in my left kidney, but that they believe I can pass this one myself too.
    Now, I have a 4mm ticking time bomb in my left side. I have named it Mike Pence because it is a pain in my side and I want it gone immediately.
